# yak2D

Samples for the [yak2D](https://github.com/AlzPatz/yak2d) framework.

yak2D is a small framework that helps quickly generate cross platform (desktop) interactive 2d graphics applications.

It offers easy to use 2d polgon and 'sprite' drawing functions, in addition to flexible render path creation and shader effects.

yak2D is built upon the Veldrid cross-platform API agnostic rendering library for .NET, along with the SDL2 via the [Veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid) Library.

## Example Screenshots
Please note the GIFs are obviously lower resolution and lower framework than is actually rendered by Yak2D
